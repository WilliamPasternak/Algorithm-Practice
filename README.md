# Algorithm Practice
This is a collection of solutions for different exercise I encountered while learning different algorithms.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

## Optimizations
When time allows, return to problems and refactor.
Include space & time complexity

## Lessons Learned:
Simply finding a solution to a problem isn't enough, it is important to work towards finding the best solution given your constraints.

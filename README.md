# Algorithm Practice
This is a collection of solutions for different exercise I encountered while learning different algorithms.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
When time allows, return to problems and refactor.
Include space & time complexity

## Lessons Learned:
Simply finding a solution to a problem isn't enough, it is important to work towards finding the best solution given your constraints.
